No:
- Spinn3r (Way too big and analysis of revolution looks nasty)
- Recipe1M+ (Not sure what kind of analysis to do on it, looks like it's for machine learing image to recipe, recipe to image)
- Chicago Food Inspections (Dataset doesn't look that interesting, looks like there is only one interesting field and it looks nasty to parse)

Maybe:
- Open Food Facts database (looks dirty, but maybe we can do some food analysis, is there too much sugar/salt?)
- Cooking recipes (Looks nasty, many html files >50'000, not sure how to parse)
- EPFL Library dataset (Looks okay but we don't know what more we can do than homework as far as analysis goes)
- Wikipedia (all and analytics) (Not very clear, nasty, looks big)

Yes:
- Dunnhumby (When people buy, are there 'groups' of buyers?, what are the most bought items?)
- Instacart (When people buy, are there 'groups' of buyers?, what are the most bought items?
- Amazon reviews (Grocery and Gourmet Food category) (Looks interesting and interesting to process, we definitely can do some analysis on what products are the best rated, ...)
- Global Food & Agriculture Statistics (Files look fairly clean, we definitely can do some agricultural analysis, what is used and how much...)
