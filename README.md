## Dataset

Our Dataset is Amazon product data from Amazon which contains information about the rating of the product. Especially, it has information about the review from the user who did it to the product.  We are planning to extract as a first step insights about the review per year. We expect to see the number of review is increasing during the years and after we will focus on the rating of the review. We will try to classify the users depend on the behaviors. We expect to have some users who is actually bot (and always do bad rating) and we expect to have some users who always do rating depend on the exist rating of this product. Also, we will try to find correlation between time and grade of review. Example, maybe during the night period the majority of the coment are bad and during the morning period the majority of the comment are good. 

List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.
